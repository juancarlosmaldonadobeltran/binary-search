# binary-search

Binary search algorithm implementation to find an ascendant sorted key's indexes list given a key value.
 
The algorithm searches inside a sorted (ascendant or descendant) array of integers called search space which could contains the given key once or multiple times.

Given an array with sorted data, e.g:  0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 15 then the binary search algorithm O(log(n)) finds all instances of element X (for instance X=7).
